## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Version 57: Enhanced Real-time Crawl Logging
- ✅ Added in-memory log buffer (500 lines) to `/api/crawl`
- ✅ Server logs now stream to frontend via GET `/api/crawl` response
- ✅ Frontend merges server logs without duplicates during polling
- ✅ Enhanced crawl progress tracking with detailed counters:
  - pagesSucceeded, pagesFailed
  - linksFound, linksSaved, linksDuplicate
- ✅ Improved error handling with detailed server-side logging
- ✅ Reset log tracking when starting new crawl sessions
- ✅ Added timestamps and structured logging throughout crawl process
- ✅ Fixed Internal Server Error issues with better error reporting

### Previous Tasks
- ✅ Fixed Turbopack build issues in `next.config.js`
- ✅ Updated Netlify deployment configuration
- ✅ 76 categories successfully crawled and stored
- ✅ 16,032 product links already crawled across categories
- ✅ Batch operations working with proxy rotation

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Testing
- [ ] Test individual "Crawl Links" operation to verify real-time logging
- [ ] Monitor logs for detailed progress: "Fetching page X/Y", "Saved N/M links", "Duplicates found"
- [ ] Test retry logic and error handling during crawl
- [ ] Verify batch operations also show detailed progress

### Deployment & Production
- [ ] Deploy enhanced logging version to Netlify
- [ ] Set up environment variables on Netlify dashboard
- [ ] Test production crawling with real Barnes & Noble data

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add pause/resume functionality for long crawl sessions
- [ ] Implement incremental crawling (only new pages)
- [ ] Add export functionality for crawled data
- [ ] Performance optimization for large-scale crawling
